# GGJ2017
Global Game Jam Project - Musical Rapids!

My game entry to the Global Game Jam 2017, a 2 day marathon of game development. 

Uses Unity/DoTween/Spine. Everything else by Richard Gaynor.

Requires Unity 5.4.3f1. Has not been tested on later versions.

To play:
1) Open in Unity.
2) Either 'Build & Run', or just start it in the editor (little play button up top).
